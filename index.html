                <h2>Once upon a time not long ago</h2>
                    <div class="intro">
                  
                        <p>
                                When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
                                When laws were stern and justice stood
                                And people were behavin like they ought ta good
                                There lived a lil boy who was misled
                                By anotha lil boy and this is what he said
                                "Me, Ya, Ty, we gonna make sum cash
                                Robbin old folks and makin tha dash"
                                They did the job, money came with ease
                                But one couldnt stop, its like he had a disease
                                He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
                                Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
                                The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
                                He said "Keep still, boy, no need for static"
                                Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
                                But little did he know the lil boy was strapped
                                The kid pulled out a gun, he said "Why did ya hit me?"
                                The barrel was set straight for the cops kidney
                                The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
                                "Ill do years if I pull this trigga"
                                So he cold dashed and ran around the block
                                 to run on........
                                Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
                                Before long the lil boy got surrounded
                                He dropped the gun, so went the glory
                                And this is the way I have end this story
                                He was only seventeen, in a madmans dream
                                The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
                                This aint funny so dont ya dare laugh
                                Just another case bout the wrong path
                                Straight n narrow or yo soul gets cast
                                
                                Good night, knock em out the box Rick, knock em out Rick</p>

                                        When the player from the Pointe didnt have no flow
                                        A brother hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the sto
                                        Caught a brother slipping, but now I lay it to the flo
                                        Just like carbon, cause I got the heat in my rhythm
                                        Momma nay not, never bragging just to stay knot
                                        Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson
                                        Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions
                                        The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
                                        But for unknown reasons cause we dont sell dope
                                        That you distribute, we dont contribute, to your clandestine
                                        Activity, my soliloquy, may be hard for some to swallow
                                        But so is cod liver oil
                                        You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
                                        Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
                                        Boa constricted, on my soul that they call

<h1>The things ill do</h1>
<h2>Imagine that</h2>
<p id="illdotext">The way to be, paradise like relaxin
    Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
    Armani Exchange deranged
    Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
    Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
    The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
    Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
    So many years of depression make me vision
    The better livin, type of place to raise kids in
    Open they eyes to the lies historys told foul
    But Im as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
    Seeing things like I was controllin, click rollin
    Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin
    Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
    Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
    Political prisoner set free, stress free
    No work release, purple M3s and jet skis
    Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
    I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
    And reverse fiends to Willies
    It sounds foul, but every girl I meetd go downtown
    Id open every cell in Attica, send em to Africa </p>
