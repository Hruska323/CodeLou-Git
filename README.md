Name: Hru llc
Purpose: Personal landscape business website.  
It is set up so I can convert it to a functioning business website once I understand the concepts further. 
I included resposive design with a media query to stack the nav bar tabs as well as stacking the images and clock with flexbox. 
I included a gallery responsive to the mouseover with JQuery. I included a JavaScript countdown clock as well.
